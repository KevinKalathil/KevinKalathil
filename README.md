### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. 

My name is Kevin Kalathil and I love to solve problems - coding is my way of doing that. 

I am currently a fourth year Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo seeking a four-month coop placement Fall 2023 (September - December).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working @ Niche as a SWE Intern
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust, trying to learn the language and work on some open-source projects that I have my eyes on
